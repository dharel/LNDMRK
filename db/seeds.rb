The building was named after Sir Edward Belcher, a British naval officer and explorer, after whom a street and a bay in the area are also named, the development fronting on the former, which explains its curious name.',

In addition, The New York Times Building, which opened in 2007, is exactly level with the Chrysler Building in height.[10] Both buildings were then pushed into fourth position, when the under-construction One World Trade Center surpassed their height, and then to fifth position by 432 Park Avenue which was completed in 2015.',

The primary structure is reinforced concrete. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to build the building is reportedly based on the government\'s decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building was named in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest tower in the world.',

It will be the centrepiece and first phase of a SR75 billion (US$20 billion)[11] proposed development known as Jeddah Economic City that will be located along the Red Sea on the north side of Jeddah. The development of Jeddah Tower seeks to bring great changes in terms of development and tourism to the city of Jeddah,[12] which is considered the most liberal city in Saudi Arabia.Initially planned to be 1.6 km (1 mile) high, the geology of the area proved unsuitable for a tower of that height. The design, created by American architect Adrian Smith, who also designed Burj Khalifa, incorporates many unique structural and aesthetic features. The creator and leader of the project is Saudi Arabian Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, the wealthiest man in the Middle East,[14] grandson of Ibn Saud, and nephew of the Kings of Saudi Arabia after him. Al-Waleed is the chairman of Kingdom Holding Company (KHC) [15] which is a partner in Jeddah Economic Company (JEC), which was formed in 2009 for the development of Jeddah Tower and City.',

      description: 'The Spear O Ranch is located near Kirby, Montana and is 45 miles north of the ranching community of Sheridan, Wyoming. Billings, Montanas largest city lies 90 miles to the northwest and has all the attractions and conveniences of a large city including many fine restaurants, shopping, banking, two hospitals and commercial air service. The Spear O Ranch lies in a pristine and beautiful setting in the heart of the Wolf Mountains, which is considered one of the most desirable ranching areas of Montana. The elevation ranges from 3,800 to 5,200 feet. This high rainfall area,with its long summer days and cool nights, is well known within the ranching industry for its ideal growing conditions and extremely high production. Improvements:As you drive into the Spear O, you are greeted by a complete set of improvements that lie at the confluence of Corral Creek and Dry Creek. The two bedroom two bath managers home, which was recently remodeled, is located here in a large grove of trees surrounded by a well landscaped yard. Across the yard from the house is an old red horse barn with the original wooden stalls still intact. It and the calving barn are connected by a new set of pipe corrals. An exceptionally well built ranch shop is used for servicing vehicles and working on ranch equipment regardless of the temperature outside. It is well insulated and built with an extra thick concrete floor which allows you to work on any kind of heavy equipment. The balance of the improvements at the headquarters includes a machine storage shed, several grain bins and the landing strip. The main family home lies in an upper meadow at the confluence of Corral Creek and Little Corral Creek and is shaded by large trees in a pristine and beautiful setting. This large expansive ranch home is where Torrey and Adrienne Johnson raised their five children, now are the present day owners of the Spear O. As you stroll through the living room, dining room and large kitchen you can easily imagine the hustle and bustle of this energetic and hard working family as they were growing up. General Operation:The Spear O Ranch has traditionally been operated as a cow calf operation. The present owners winter the majority of the cowherd on the north end of the ranch at lower elevations, where you can normally winter out on the range until January before starting supplemental feeding. This part of the ranch contains several deeded parcels and a combination of tribal, competent and office leases that have been part of the Spear O for 100 plus years. The cow herd stays on this part of the ranch through calving season before returning to Corral Creek and Dry Creek in late spring, where they graze the higher elevations of the ranch until weaning and shipping in October or November. Water Resources: The Spear O Ranch is blessed with nearly 15 miles of mountain streams flowing through its three main drainages. These streams are Corral Creek, Little Corral Creek and Dry Creek. Free flowing clear mountain water, along with numerous developed springs and reservoirs, provide excellent stock water for the ranchs cow herd. These drainages are lined with choke cherry, wild plum and service berry, providing food and habitat for many species of wildlife. There are scattered patches of quaking aspens, while the ridges and peaks are covered with scattered to dense pine. The lower reaches of these streams open into wide valleys and are lined with productive hay meadows. The meadows are planted to alfalfa or forage crops to supply the winters feed supply. Most of the ranch receives over 20 inches of precipitation on a normal year. Two crops of alfalfa are normally produced with the third crop used for fall grazing.
